# QtSixA
The QtSixA program originally created by falkTX, allows linux suppport for ps3 game pads.

QtSixA was originally created by falkTX, the original project page is http://qtsixa.sourceforge.net/ I am just cleaning it up,
moving it to a new PPA for ubuntu/debian current releases to make it easier for users to access with possible improovement in future.

#QtSixA

###QtSixA is the Sixaxis Joystick Manager
 ------------------------------------

QtSixA can connect PS3 hardware (Sixaxis/DualShock3, Keypads and Remotes)
to a Linux-compatible machine.

"QtSixA" is the GUI (interface), while "sixad" is the backend C++ code.

Currently sixad supports:
 - Sixaxis/DualShock3 (buttons, axis, accelerometers, leds and rumble)
 - PS3 Keypads
 - PS3 BD Remotes

sixad also registers the hardware's MAC/ID in the device name
(ex: "PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller (00:XX:X0:0X:XX)".

 -------------------------------------

QtSixA and sixad are licensed under the GNU GPL v3 license.
