# QtSixA
The QtSixA program originally created by falkTX, allows linux suppport for ps3 game pads.

QtSixA was originally created by falkTX, the original project page is http://qtsixa.sourceforge.net/ I am just cleaning it up,
moving it to a new PPA for ubuntu/debian current releases to make it easier for users to access with possible improovement in future.
